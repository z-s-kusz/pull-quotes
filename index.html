      <article class="main-grid">
        <p class="center-column">Certain media outlets for some reason take quotes out of their articles and pepper them throughout. These highlights
        make sense in physical print media but are distracting in a digital format. I will never be leafing through a website. I
        will scroll through it or click the next button. I don't fold open a website at the dentist's office and look for eye
        catching coverage to make me read an article.</p>
        <section class="center-column pointless-highlight">"These highlights make sense in physical print media but are distracting in a digital format."</section>
        <p class="center-column">Wikipedia has the whole thing covered, apparently it is called a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pull_quote">‚Äúpull quote‚Äù</a>. Info, pros and cons are all listed there
        much better than I could cover them. Apparently pull quotes do have a place on the web but I still dislike them enough
        to make this parody page. That's all I have, the rest of this is just filler to make it look better. I've got it, I'll
        add another one at the bottom!</p>
        <section class="center-column pointless-highlight">"Are these sections more annoying when placed after, or before they appear in the article?" </section>
        <p class="center-column">But before I go, my final question is this; Are these sections more annoying when placed after,
          or before they appear in the article?</p>

        WEIRD is where yesterday is theorized. It is the life blood of data and concepts that supersede the universe's limitless
        transcendence. The WEIRD dogma illustriates how NFTs can penetrate our lives - from conquest to poka, from tourism
        to denim. The ground-shattering projections and feudalism that we release jump-start new indentations, new vibrations,
        and new preconceptions.
